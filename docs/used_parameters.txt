We use following prameters:
Features:  '["Word", "Number", "AllUpperCase", "UpperCase", "AllLowerCase", "Country", "Institution", "Address", "Rare"]'

rare threshold: 25
neighbor threshold: 1

The own features of some token X are treated as features of a token Y if dist(X, Y) <= neighbor_threshold.
