For 1000, Word, best nei_thr = 3
For Word, there is significant improvemnt from 1000 to 4000
If we train using 4000 words and many features, it is slightly better to use nei_thr = 1 than nei_thr = 2.
It is true also when we start adding features.

Rare
If rare blocks the word, the bigger the rare threshold, the worse outcomes! 
This is true also, when we add more features.
If Rare doesn't block the word, the optimal value seems to sit between 16 and 32
(16 is better), interestingly, 128 also behaves well.
For n = 4000 Rare = 19, 25 are the best

Dicts:
Together with sole Word: 
The country feature is the best. 
Institution makes significant (?) improvement.
Address gives some improvement.
StopWord gives a tiny improvement, it is better when it is case-sensitive
StopWordEng is neutral (spolis some things and imporves other things)
City is neutral (slightly bad) (good for address, bad for institution)
State is slightly bad,
state code is slightly worse.

Something weird with this country, do we get different results every time !! ?

Adding number is a big win :)
Adding UpperCase is a lose
But then adding AllUpperCase makes it better than no two of them
Adding sep then improves slightly
Adding nonal is a lose.

When we add AllUpper, it is good to add Upper too.
We can add AllLower for consistency, it doesn't change much

Using both country and inst leads to good results.

Having word, number, upper, allupper, country, inst, addr is a good option, everything seems to 
give some improvement. 
Similar results with: word, number, country, inst, addr
Adding stop seems to spoil it a little
Adding sep is debatable, some parameters go up, the others go down. Maybe sep should look for other characters?
Maybe Rare is faulty??
